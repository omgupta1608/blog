    title: "What are Communication Protocols?",
    body: "<p>Protocols are basically a set of rules that two machines must follow in order to communicate with each other. Machines can communicate in basically 2 ways: Either over the network or by physically connecting with each other using wires/cables.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>What protocols do is they standardize each step of the entire process of two machines communicating with each other. And these steps are actually designed in a way that the protocol as a whole fits the use-case and efficiently solves the problem it was designed for.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The cool part is that anyone can build their own protocol depending on their use-case. Though designing your own protocol and using it in your infrastructure is usually not an easy thing to do but big firms with hundreds of engineers might try to do it and it may or may not be successful.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Some popular examples of communication protocols are:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</li>\n  <li>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</li>\n  <li>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) - h1.1, h2, h3</li>\n  <li>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</li>\n  <li>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</li>\n  <li>Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)</li>\n  <li>and many more...</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Every protocol has some properties which effectively differentiate one from the other. There are a lot of properties linked with a protocol but some of them are very common and important, so let's take a look.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Protocol Properties</h3>\n<p><strong>Data Format</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Data format specifies the language in which the two machines talk to each other. And by language, I don't mean programming language. Data formats can either be <strong>Plain text, </strong>which means it can actually be read by humans like JSON, XML, or just simple text, or <strong>Binary, </strong>which I think needs no description.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>State</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The state of a protocol basically tells us if the protocol depends on the state(s) of either or both of the participants. Protocols can either be <strong>stateful</strong> or <strong>stateless</strong>.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Direction</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>By direction, I mean the direction freedom of communication, i.e., <strong>unidirectional</strong> or <strong>bidirectional</strong> (aka bidi).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Transfer Mode</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Transfer mode refers to the way of transferring data between participants. Now people often get confused with the terminology but transfer mode can be <strong>Message based </strong>(data is sent as packets, basically it's easy to identify where a message starts and ends) or <strong>Stream based </strong>(data is sent as a continuous stream of bytes, nonstop).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Addressing</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Addressing is actually a complex property as it diffrentiates protocols by specifying which layer the protocol works in (by layer I mean, a layer of the OSI model).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Error Management</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Tells us how the protocol handle errors. Like the most popular protocol, HTTP uses status codes to identify different errors.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We should realize that protocols are very use-case specific and designed to solve a particular problem, and the popular ones that we all know about - TCP, UDP, HTTP, gRPC, were all built to solve a problem.</p>",

    title: "How does a Quantum Computer work?",
    body: "<p>In classical computers, we use Cbits (Classical Bits) to perform operations and each bit can have 2 possible values. It can either be a <strong>1</strong> or a <strong>0</strong>, like a light switch, it can either be on or off, there's no in-between. Now in quantum computers, we use Qubits (Quantum Bits) whose values also range between 0 and 1 but the crazy part is that they can take values both 0 and 1 at the same time. This gives quantum computers their superior computing power. Seems interesting? Let's dive deeper.<br>\n<br>\nThere are many physical objects that can be used as Qubits. An electron, a single photon, etc. We know that electrons are like tiny magnets and get aligned to an external magnetic field just like a compass needle aligns with the earth's magnetic field. We use this property to strictly align the electron. If the electron aligns opposite to that of the direction of the magnetic field, we call the configuration a <strong>zero state</strong> and when it aligns with the field we call it the <strong>one state</strong>. Now this seems similar to a classical bit, having two states, <em>zero and one</em>.<br>\n<br>\nNow just as we start to think that we have solved the problem and quantum computers are ready to use, we come across a funny thing about quantum bits, i.e. the quantum object used to make that qubit can be in both (zero and one) states at once. When you measure the state it will either be one or zero but before the measurement, the object is in a state of <strong>quantum superposition</strong>. You might have heard people say that in quantum mechanics, an object can be at two positions at the same time. That's exactly what they are talking about, <em>superposition</em> and it is <strong>not</strong> as crazy as it sounds. Let me tell you why. When an object is in superposition (i.e. before measurement), the only thing we can tell about the object's state is the probability of that object having a particular state <em>if that makes any sense</em>. Let's take an example.<br>\n<br>\nSuppose we have a qubit in a state of <em>quantum superposition</em> of <strong>1</strong> and <strong>0</strong>. We can write it as:<br>\n</p>\n<pre><code>X|1&gt; and Y|0&gt;</code></pre>\n<p><br>\nNow don't get overwhelmed by the notations, it's just a way of writing what we talked about above in the quantum mechanical language called the <strong>Bra–ket notation</strong>. Notice the variables <em><strong>X</strong></em> and <em><strong>Y</strong></em>. These are the relative probabilities of the qubit having the state 1 and 0, after measurement, respectively. If someone asks, What's the probability that the qubit is a <strong>1</strong> when I measure it? It's <em><strong>X</strong></em>. And similarly, <em><strong>Y </strong></em>is the probability of getting a <strong>0.</strong><br>\n<br>\nNow let's take things to the next level, coz why not? <br>\n<br>\nTill now we talked about only 1 qubit, but that's not ideal. Imagine having 2 qubits in a system. You would think that representing the 2 qubits will be the same as representing 2 cbits like:<br>\n</p>\n<pre><code>2 Cbits have 4 possible combinations&nbsp;</code></pre>\n<pre><code>0 0, 0 1, 1 0, 1 1&nbsp;</code></pre>\n<pre><code>In case of 2 qubits, each qubit have 2 variables linked to each possible states, hence making the total number for the entire system, 4.</code></pre>\n<pre><code>A| 0|0&gt;&nbsp;</code></pre>\n<pre><code>B| 01 + 10&gt;&nbsp;</code></pre>\n<pre><code>C| 01 - 10&gt;&nbsp;</code></pre>\n<pre><code>D| 1|1&gt; &nbsp;</code></pre>\n<pre><code>A,B,C,D are respective relative probability of each configuration.</code></pre>\n<p><br>\n<br>\nThis means that we need 4 numbers to determine the state of this system, which only required 2 numbers in case of 2 cbits. Thus, 2 qubits actually contain 4 bits of information. Similarly, if we have 3 qubits we can store 8 bits of information. 4 qubits, 16 bits of information, and so on...<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<pre><code>Having N qubits, we can store 2^N bits of information</code></pre>\n<p><br>\n<br>\nThe power of quantum computers as compared to classical computers, grows exponentially. Now you get a pretty decent idea of how quantum computers work and how powerful they are. But as everything has some downsides, quantum computers are no exception. We know and understand that quantum computers are powerful but with this power comes a great deal of problems like the need for specific conditions in which these computers can operate and other stability issues. Harnessing the power of sub-atomic particles like electrons and photons, and using them on our command is no easy task. But despite all this, we're making some serious progress.</p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>IBM's Osprey </strong>is currently the world's most powerful quantum computer, operating with a staggering <strong>433 qubits</strong>. That is equivalent to <em>2^433</em> classical bits. You can do the math on your own or maybe just ask ChatGPT for the answer. <em>(Fun fact: ask chatGPT to recalculate and it will give you a different answer every time. We still have a long way to go.)</em><br>\n<br>\nI tried to be as simple as possible with this topic and there are obviously some really complex details hidden in almost everything we talked about in this blog but it's important for us to understand that quantum computers are really not the replacement of classical computers. Yet.</p>",

    title: "The real meaning of APIs",
    body: "<p>At some point in your tech (or maybe non-tech, but closely related) career you must have come across the word <strong>API</strong>. If not, then get ready to learn something new today.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Most of the (software) engineers out there, when hearing the word API, instantly think about a website or a mobile app requesting data from a server, and the server responding with the data that was requested. And that this communication happens with the help of APIs. Now, I won't say it's completely wrong to think about APIs this way, I mean you can go a long way without ever knowing what exactly APIs mean, but it's not completely right.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h4>A closer look</h4>\n<p>The full form of API is \"<strong>Application Programming Interface\" </strong>which seems a bit confusing at first but is actually the perfect name. Let's take a closer look.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>APIs are a piece of software that helps two or more computer programs communicate with each other. Requesting for services from another computer program is done via APIs. It's an <strong>interface </strong>between the two communicating programs. Any two computer programs, not necessarily a website talking to a web server, but even a C++ program talking to the Kernel, use APIs. APIs are more linked to requesting and providing services than they are to the types of computer programs.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Just like a <strong>user interface</strong> connects the users to the computer, an <strong>application programming interface</strong> connects different computer programs with each other.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>HTTP APIs</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I think the main reason why people tend to think of the web client-server scenario I talked about in the beginning is that it is the most common and abundant use-case of APIs that is visible and known even to the most naive. Web Development is the most popular field in tech and there's a good chance that APIs will be one of the first few things you learn even if you're a front-end developer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>When a client requests data from a server over the web, the type of API used is called the <strong>HTTP API</strong>. It obviously has more details to it but that's a story for another blog.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>DOM APIs</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>When writing Javascript on the front end we often want to access DOM (Document Object Model) elements (elements in the HTML) in our JS code. Most of you must already know this but we do this using the function:</p>\n<pre><code>document.getElementById(\"hello\");</code></pre>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This <em>getElementById </em>function is an API provided by the browser that we use to request for the element having the provided ID and it responds to us with that element. Seems very similar to the good old client-server architecture discussed above but the only difference is that the type of computer programs interacting, in this case, is different. Here your <strong>JS program</strong> is talking to the <strong>Browser</strong>. And it's known as the <strong>DOM API </strong>or <strong>Browser API</strong>.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>For your reference: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>APIs can be thought of as a way of requesting and receiving services from another computer program that provides those services. It doesn't matter who is requesting the services and who is responding to these requests. As discussed above, thinking of HTTP APIs as the only meaning of APIs is not wrong but is almost exactly like using the word <strong>Velcro </strong>for a hook-and-loop fastener.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>",

    title: "A trip to Singapore!",
    body: "<p>This is the first of, hopefully, many travel blogs I am gonna write in the future. I recently visited Singapore and was completely awestruck by how organized, humble, well-maintained, and mesmerizing (a hundred more adjectives…) the country and its people are. This blog is a concise description of my experiences there and things that I think are worth sharing.</p>\n<p><img src='https://picsum.photos/700/300'><br></p>\n<p>Over my entire stay, I met sooooo many people, some only once and some coincidentally twice 😂. I was on my way to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and was looking for rental bicycles to ride along the river and enjoy the view. I got out of the Bayfront MRT station and asked the first person I saw. He said he wasn’t local and was also looking for a way to the Singapore Flyer. And luckily, I knew it. So we walked together for a while, trying to know a bit about each other. He was visiting Singapore from Taiwan. Then after showing him the way, we parted ways and I realised I didn’t even ask his name. The very next day I went to Chinatown. And coincidentally I saw him there as well. I went over to say hello and he was so surprised to see me. I asked for his name this time, Kriss Twu.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The day I went to the MBS hotel I was searching for a food court and I walked by the famous Marquee Singapore Club (Singapore’s biggest club, with a 3-story slide and a Ferris wheel inside of it 🤯) and saw a banner saying “Bassjackers 3rd Nov”, and I was like, I have to see them. Most of you might not know who Bassjackers are, they’re DJ Duo. I immediately bought the tickets online and was prepared to see them the next night. In the club, I met a group of guys from Japan, enjoying their time in Singapore. We immediately hit it off as they were roughly the same age as me. I also got the chance to fist-bump a DJ I listen to 😎, so yeah, there’s that.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Singapore is filled with beautiful places and I tried to visit as many of them as I could. The places I went to and absolutely enjoyed were:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The sunset view from The MBS Observation Deck - $32 per head (no time limit)</li>\n  <li>The Singapore Zoo and Night Safari - $50 each per head</li>\n  <li>Diwali lights all over Little India - if you are visiting during the Diwali season 😁</li>\n  <li>The light and sound show at Gardens by the Bay - No tickets required</li>\n  <li>The Singapore Science Center - $12 per head</li>\n  <li>Singapore River Cruise 🌊 - $32 per head</li>\n  <li>Jewel Changi Airport - No tickets required</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And now you already know what’s left.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>THE<em> FOOOOOOOOOD</em>. I’ve always been amazed by experiencing foods from different cuisines and trying dishes I have never even heard of, and Singapore was obviously no exception.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>I had, my all-time favorite, Roasted Chicken Rice 🤤, it’s absolutely delicious! - from Koufu Food Center</li>\n  <li>I tried Nasi Lemak, a Malay cuisine that consists of fragrant rice cooked in coconut milk and Pandan leaf (said Google). Served with different types of meat, including Chicken. - available at any Hawker Center</li>\n  <li>Matcha Ice cream - a Japanese-inspired treat - from Creamier</li>\n  <li>Pistachio Baklava and Goat Milk Ice cream - from Ottoman Turkish Delights, Haji Lane</li>\n  <li>Duck Chop Noodles - any Hawker Center</li>\n  <li>Fish Balls and Minced Meat Noodles - any Hawker Center</li>\n  <li>Roti Prata with Mutton Korma - from Tekka Center, Little India</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To sum up, Singapore is worth visiting any time of the year and for anyone who wants a sweet escape ✨</p>",
