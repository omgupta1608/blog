    title: "What are Communication Protocols?",
    body: "<p>Protocols are basically a set of rules that two machines must follow in order to communicate with each other. Machines can communicate in basically 2 ways: Either over the network or by physically connecting with each other using wires/cables.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>What protocols do is they standardize each step of the entire process of two machines communicating with each other. And these steps are actually designed in a way that the protocol as a whole fits the use-case and efficiently solves the problem it was designed for.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The cool part is that anyone can build their own protocol depending on their use-case. Though designing your own protocol and using it in your infrastructure is usually not an easy thing to do but big firms with hundreds of engineers might try to do it and it may or may not be successful.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Some popular examples of communication protocols are:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</li>\n  <li>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</li>\n  <li>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) - h1.1, h2, h3</li>\n  <li>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</li>\n  <li>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</li>\n  <li>Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)</li>\n  <li>and many more...</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Every protocol has some properties which effectively differentiate one from the other. There are a lot of properties linked with a protocol but some of them are very common and important, so let's take a look.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Protocol Properties</h3>\n<p><strong>Data Format</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Data format specifies the language in which the two machines talk to each other. And by language, I don't mean programming language. Data formats can either be <strong>Plain text, </strong>which means it can actually be read by humans like JSON, XML, or just simple text, or <strong>Binary, </strong>which I think needs no description.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>State</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The state of a protocol basically tells us if the protocol depends on the state(s) of either or both of the participants. Protocols can either be <strong>stateful</strong> or <strong>stateless</strong>.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Direction</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>By direction, I mean the direction freedom of communication, i.e., <strong>unidirectional</strong> or <strong>bidirectional</strong> (aka bidi).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Transfer Mode</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Transfer mode refers to the way of transferring data between participants. Now people often get confused with the terminology but transfer mode can be <strong>Message based </strong>(data is sent as packets, basically it's easy to identify where a message starts and ends) or <strong>Stream based </strong>(data is sent as a continuous stream of bytes, nonstop).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Addressing</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Addressing is actually a complex property as it diffrentiates protocols by specifying which layer the protocol works in (by layer I mean, a layer of the OSI model).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Error Management</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Tells us how the protocol handle errors. Like the most popular protocol, HTTP uses status codes to identify different errors.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We should realize that protocols are very use-case specific and designed to solve a particular problem, and the popular ones that we all know about - TCP, UDP, HTTP, gRPC, were all built to solve a problem.</p>",

    title: "How does a Quantum Computer work?",
    body: "<p>In classical computers, we use Cbits (Classical Bits) to perform operations and each bit can have 2 possible values. It can either be a <strong>1</strong> or a <strong>0</strong>, like a light switch, it can either be on or off, there's no in-between. Now in quantum computers, we use Qubits (Quantum Bits) whose values also range between 0 and 1 but the crazy part is that they can take values both 0 and 1 at the same time. This gives quantum computers their superior computing power. Seems interesting? Let's dive deeper.<br>\n<br>\nThere are many physical objects that can be used as Qubits. An electron, a single photon, etc. We know that electrons are like tiny magnets and get aligned to an external magnetic field just like a compass needle aligns with the earth's magnetic field. We use this property to strictly align the electron. If the electron aligns opposite to that of the direction of the magnetic field, we call the configuration a <strong>zero state</strong> and when it aligns with the field we call it the <strong>one state</strong>. Now this seems similar to a classical bit, having two states, <em>zero and one</em>.<br>\n<br>\nNow just as we start to think that we have solved the problem and quantum computers are ready to use, we come across a funny thing about quantum bits, i.e. the quantum object used to make that qubit can be in both (zero and one) states at once. When you measure the state it will either be one or zero but before the measurement, the object is in a state of <strong>quantum superposition</strong>. You might have heard people say that in quantum mechanics, an object can be at two positions at the same time. That's exactly what they are talking about, <em>superposition</em> and it is <strong>not</strong> as crazy as it sounds. Let me tell you why. When an object is in superposition (i.e. before measurement), the only thing we can tell about the object's state is the probability of that object having a particular state <em>if that makes any sense</em>. Let's take an example.<br>\n<br>\nSuppose we have a qubit in a state of <em>quantum superposition</em> of <strong>1</strong> and <strong>0</strong>. We can write it as:<br>\n</p>\n<pre><code>X|1&gt; and Y|0&gt;</code></pre>\n<p><br>\nNow don't get overwhelmed by the notations, it's just a way of writing what we talked about above in the quantum mechanical language called the <strong>Bra–ket notation</strong>. Notice the variables <em><strong>X</strong></em> and <em><strong>Y</strong></em>. These are the relative probabilities of the qubit having the state 1 and 0, after measurement, respectively. If someone asks, What's the probability that the qubit is a <strong>1</strong> when I measure it? It's <em><strong>X</strong></em>. And similarly, <em><strong>Y </strong></em>is the probability of getting a <strong>0.</strong><br>\n<br>\nNow let's take things to the next level, coz why not? <br>\n<br>\nTill now we talked about only 1 qubit, but that's not ideal. Imagine having 2 qubits in a system. You would think that representing the 2 qubits will be the same as representing 2 cbits like:<br>\n</p>\n<pre><code>2 Cbits have 4 possible combinations&nbsp;</code></pre>\n<pre><code>0 0, 0 1, 1 0, 1 1&nbsp;</code></pre>\n<pre><code>In case of 2 qubits, each qubit have 2 variables linked to each possible states, hence making the total number for the entire system, 4.</code></pre>\n<pre><code>A| 0|0&gt;&nbsp;</code></pre>\n<pre><code>B| 01 + 10&gt;&nbsp;</code></pre>\n<pre><code>C| 01 - 10&gt;&nbsp;</code></pre>\n<pre><code>D| 1|1&gt; &nbsp;</code></pre>\n<pre><code>A,B,C,D are respective relative probability of each configuration.</code></pre>\n<p><br>\n<br>\nThis means that we need 4 numbers to determine the state of this system, which only required 2 numbers in case of 2 cbits. Thus, 2 qubits actually contain 4 bits of information. Similarly, if we have 3 qubits we can store 8 bits of information. 4 qubits, 16 bits of information, and so on...<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<pre><code>Having N qubits, we can store 2^N bits of information</code></pre>\n<p><br>\n<br>\nThe power of quantum computers as compared to classical computers, grows exponentially. Now you get a pretty decent idea of how quantum computers work and how powerful they are. But as everything has some downsides, quantum computers are no exception. We know and understand that quantum computers are powerful but with this power comes a great deal of problems like the need for specific conditions in which these computers can operate and other stability issues. Harnessing the power of sub-atomic particles like electrons and photons, and using them on our command is no easy task. But despite all this, we're making some serious progress.</p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>IBM's Osprey </strong>is currently the world's most powerful quantum computer, operating with a staggering <strong>433 qubits</strong>. That is equivalent to <em>2^433</em> classical bits. You can do the math on your own or maybe just ask ChatGPT for the answer. <em>(Fun fact: ask chatGPT to recalculate and it will give you a different answer every time. We still have a long way to go.)</em><br>\n<br>\nI tried to be as simple as possible with this topic and there are obviously some really complex details hidden in almost everything we talked about in this blog but it's important for us to understand that quantum computers are really not the replacement of classical computers. Yet.</p>",

    title: "The real meaning of APIs",
    body: "<p>At some point in your tech (or maybe non-tech, but closely related) career you must have come across the word <strong>API</strong>. If not, then get ready to learn something new today.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Most of the (software) engineers out there, when hearing the word API, instantly think about a website or a mobile app requesting data from a server, and the server responding with the data that was requested. And that this communication happens with the help of APIs. Now, I won't say it's completely wrong to think about APIs this way, I mean you can go a long way without ever knowing what exactly APIs mean, but it's not completely right.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h4>A closer look</h4>\n<p>The full form of API is \"<strong>Application Programming Interface\" </strong>which seems a bit confusing at first but is actually the perfect name. Let's take a closer look.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>APIs are a piece of software that helps two or more computer programs communicate with each other. Requesting for services from another computer program is done via APIs. It's an <strong>interface </strong>between the two communicating programs. Any two computer programs, not necessarily a website talking to a web server, but even a C++ program talking to the Kernel, use APIs. APIs are more linked to requesting and providing services than they are to the types of computer programs.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Just like a <strong>user interface</strong> connects the users to the computer, an <strong>application programming interface</strong> connects different computer programs with each other.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>HTTP APIs</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>I think the main reason why people tend to think of the web client-server scenario I talked about in the beginning is that it is the most common and abundant use-case of APIs that is visible and known even to the most naive. Web Development is the most popular field in tech and there's a good chance that APIs will be one of the first few things you learn even if you're a front-end developer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>When a client requests data from a server over the web, the type of API used is called the <strong>HTTP API</strong>. It obviously has more details to it but that's a story for another blog.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>DOM APIs</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>When writing Javascript on the front end we often want to access DOM (Document Object Model) elements (elements in the HTML) in our JS code. Most of you must already know this but we do this using the function:</p>\n<pre><code>document.getElementById(\"hello\");</code></pre>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This <em>getElementById </em>function is an API provided by the browser that we use to request for the element having the provided ID and it responds to us with that element. Seems very similar to the good old client-server architecture discussed above but the only difference is that the type of computer programs interacting, in this case, is different. Here your <strong>JS program</strong> is talking to the <strong>Browser</strong>. And it's known as the <strong>DOM API </strong>or <strong>Browser API</strong>.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>For your reference: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>APIs can be thought of as a way of requesting and receiving services from another computer program that provides those services. It doesn't matter who is requesting the services and who is responding to these requests. As discussed above, thinking of HTTP APIs as the only meaning of APIs is not wrong but is almost exactly like using the word <strong>Velcro </strong>for a hook-and-loop fastener.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>",

    title: "A trip to Singapore!",
    body: "<p>This is the first of, hopefully, many travel blogs I am gonna write in the future. I recently visited Singapore and was completely awestruck by how organized, humble, well-maintained, and mesmerizing (a hundred more adjectives…) the country and its people are. This blog is a concise description of my experiences there and things that I think are worth sharing.</p><br/><p>Over my entire stay, I met sooooo many people, some only once and some coincidentally twice 😂. I was on my way to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and was looking for rental bicycles to ride along the river and enjoy the view. I got out of the Bayfront MRT station and asked the first person I saw. He said he wasn’t local and was also looking for a way to the Singapore Flyer. And luckily, I knew it. So we walked together for a while, trying to know a bit about each other. He was visiting Singapore from Taiwan. Then after showing him the way, we parted ways and I realised I didn’t even ask his name. The very next day I went to Chinatown. And coincidentally I saw him there as well. I went over to say hello and he was so surprised to see me. I asked for his name this time, Kriss Twu.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The day I went to the MBS hotel I was searching for a food court and I walked by the famous Marquee Singapore Club (Singapore’s biggest club, with a 3-story slide and a Ferris wheel inside of it 🤯) and saw a banner saying “Bassjackers 3rd Nov”, and I was like, I have to see them. Most of you might not know who Bassjackers are, they’re DJ Duo. I immediately bought the tickets online and was prepared to see them the next night. In the club, I met a group of guys from Japan, enjoying their time in Singapore. We immediately hit it off as they were roughly the same age as me. I also got the chance to fist-bump a DJ I listen to 😎, so yeah, there’s that.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Singapore is filled with beautiful places and I tried to visit as many of them as I could. The places I went to and absolutely enjoyed were:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The sunset view from The MBS Observation Deck - $32 per head (no time limit)</li>\n  <li>The Singapore Zoo and Night Safari - $50 each per head</li>\n  <li>Diwali lights all over Little India - if you are visiting during the Diwali season 😁</li>\n  <li>The light and sound show at Gardens by the Bay - No tickets required</li>\n  <li>The Singapore Science Center - $12 per head</li>\n  <li>Singapore River Cruise 🌊 - $32 per head</li>\n  <li>Jewel Changi Airport - No tickets required</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And now you already know what’s left.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>THE<em> FOOOOOOOOOD</em>. I’ve always been amazed by experiencing foods from different cuisines and trying dishes I have never even heard of, and Singapore was obviously no exception.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>I had, my all-time favorite, Roasted Chicken Rice 🤤, it’s absolutely delicious! - from Koufu Food Center</li>\n  <li>I tried Nasi Lemak, a Malay cuisine that consists of fragrant rice cooked in coconut milk and Pandan leaf (said Google). Served with different types of meat, including Chicken. - available at any Hawker Center</li>\n  <li>Matcha Ice cream - a Japanese-inspired treat - from Creamier</li>\n  <li>Pistachio Baklava and Goat Milk Ice cream - from Ottoman Turkish Delights, Haji Lane</li>\n  <li>Duck Chop Noodles - any Hawker Center</li>\n  <li>Fish Balls and Minced Meat Noodles - any Hawker Center</li>\n  <li>Roti Prata with Mutton Korma - from Tekka Center, Little India</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To sum up, Singapore is worth visiting any time of the year and for anyone who wants a sweet escape ✨</p>",

    title: "Machine Learning - A bird’s eye view",
    body: "<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the words &ldquo;Machine Learning&rdquo;?</strong></p> <p>This is what I asked myself a couple of weeks ago, and I realized that the concept is pure genius.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Machine Learning has always fascinated me, but I never really got the chance to explore its greatness until recently. I&rsquo;ve decided to navigate the world of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), which at this point are nothing more than buzzwords to me. But in the coming weeks, I&rsquo;ll be slowly diving deep into this unknown territory and documenting almost everything I learn in the process.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span style=\"background-color:#dddddd\">😇 <em>I welcome comments, suggestions, insights, and corrections on my content. Your input will enhance my learning journey.</span></em></strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So let&rsquo;s start by looking at the formal definition of ML</p> <br> <blockquote> <p><em>Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. &mdash; Arthur Samuel, 1959</em></p> </blockquote><br> <p>&ldquo;<em>the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed </em>&rdquo; is something that caught my eye the first time I read it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>You see, computers are designed to be programmed to do a certain or a set of certain jobs, which they do, in most cases, better than humans. But they are limited to that. Expecting a computer to do a job that it is not programmed for doesn&rsquo;t make sense. ML aims to do just that, or almost that.</p><br> <p>Classical computer systems like your or my laptop cannot be made to learn things. It&rsquo;s a whole new paradigm for which these machines are not designed for. So do you have to purchase a new machine that is capable of learning? Obviously not! Machine learning can be thought of as a software that runs on classical computers (uses its resources like RAM, CPU etc.), giving it the superpower of learning independently. This software is what ML or AI engineers develop and work on. It is called an <em>ML Model</em>.</p> <br><p>The process of developing an ML Model includes several steps, challenges, and iterations after which the model is ready to be used. But what does &ldquo;using an ML model mean&rdquo;? The answer to this question comes from the very reason of using machine learning in the first place, and I think the best way to explain this is through a simple example:</p> <br><hr/> <p><em>Let&#39;s say you are a software engineer at a credit card company and you are asked to build a system that tells whether a transaction is fraudulent. This is a very common use case of machine learning called &ldquo;Anomaly Detection&rdquo; but let&rsquo;s try to solve it using traditional computing first.</p> <p>So you created a script that runs every time a customer makes a transaction and it outputs whether the transaction was fraudulent. Let&rsquo;s say you do this by checking the following things in a transaction:</p> <ol> <li>If the number of transactions is greater than a certain limit per day</li> <li>Whether the beneficiary is genuine or not by checking their reputation</li> <li>The location of the transaction</li> </ol> <p>All this might work in ideal scenarios but the real world is very unpredictable.</p> <br><p>What if a customer decides to go to a different country and makes several legitimate transactions within a day?</p><br><p> What if a genuine beneficiary&#39;s reputation suddenly changes due to unforeseen circumstances?</p><br><p> What if a customer frequently travels for work or personal reasons, resulting in transactions from different locations?</p><br><p> These real-world complexities pose challenges for traditional rule-based anomaly detection systems.</p> <br><p>This is where Machine Learning comes in.</em></p><br><hr/><br> <p>Machine learning will help us build a system that recognizes patterns in user behaviors and other edge cases and makes informed decisions about whether a transaction is fraudulent. Let&rsquo;s see how we can build this on a higher level.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2>Building an ML model</h2> <h3>Data collection and Training</h3> <p>Just like an athlete has to go through rigorous training before they can compete in real competitions, ML Models also need to go through <code><strong>training</strong></code> in order to perform better. Training is when a model is given <code><strong>labelled data</strong></code> (in our case, a list of transactions with an additional field to tell if the transaction was a fraud or not) and it finds patterns in it. This usually requires a lot of data, and one of the most important parts of machine learning is to have a rich dataset. The quality of training and the resultant trained model depends both on the quality of data provided during training and the algorithm used. It&rsquo;s an ML Engineer&rsquo;s job to find the latter, that suits best for a particular use case.</p> <h3>Testing</h3> <p>Once a model is trained the next step would be to test how well the training went. This step is called, testing or validating a model. The trained model is given unlabelled data that it has never seen before and asked to make a <code><strong>prediction</strong></code>. Predictions are actually what we want the model to do, and we judge it by seeing how accurate its predictions are. This measure is called, a no-brainer, the <code><strong>accuracy</strong></code> of a model. The better the model, the higher is its accuracy.</p> <h3>Reiterating and deployment</h3> <p>If the testing doesn&rsquo;t go as planned, we would want to use a different approach for training. This different approach can be taken by either changing the underlying algorithm or changing the parameters (in our case, the amount spent, location, beneficiary, etc.) or improving the quality of data until we are satisfied by the model&#39;s accuracy. Now we have our model ready, but it&rsquo;s on our machine. How do we make it available for everyone to use it? This is when we deploy our model either to the cloud or to the user&rsquo;s machine.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We learned what ML is and why we use it. We saw the process of building our own ML model and making it available for people to use it. I hope you get the intuition behind machine learning and why it&rsquo;s so powerful. We&rsquo;ll go through every part of this blog in much greater detail, and many other things I couldn&rsquo;t fit in this one. Everything explained above definitely deserves and will have separate blog(s) of its own when we&rsquo;ll dive deeper into these concepts.</p>",

    title: "Vibrant Vietnam 🇻🇳",
    body: '<p>Hey there! I got back from Vietnam just three days back and I\'m bursting to share all the amazing stuff we experienced there. Let me tell you, it\'s one heck of a country – the food, the sights, the people, the culture, everything\'s just incredible!</p>\n<p>So, I touched down in <strong>Hanoi</strong> around 2 am. Waited about three hours at the airport for the gang to arrive. Some of them were flying in from <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, so they got in around 9 am. We hopped on a bus to the city centre since the airport\'s a bit out of the way.</p>\n<h2>Day 1</h2>\n<p>As soon as we got there, we noticed it\'s not like your usual busy city despite of being the capital of the country. People were out and about, riding tuk-tuks, wearing those iconic conical hats, drinking and eating, chatting with friends, just having a blast. And it was just a regular Wednesday morning!</p>\n<p>We exchanged some cash – about ₹ 1000 – at the airport, which got us around ₫ 30000 (Vietnamese dong). Hungry as heck, we hit the streets for some local grub like duck soup noodles. Learned how to say "hello" and "thank you" in Vietnamese – <em>Xin chào</em> (pronounced: Shin Chao) and <em>Cảm ơn</em> (pronounced: Kh Man) – and that\'s pretty much all we said for the rest of the trip 😂!</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>After that, we checked out the <strong>One Pillar Pagoda</strong>, this cool temple perched on a single pillar. Had <em>Char kway teow, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Laksa</em> for lunch. Then, we caught a bus to Sa Pa late at night and dozed off as soon as we got on board.</p>\n<h2>Day 2</h2>\n<p>Once we reached <strong>Sa Pa</strong>, we headed to our hotel. Freshened up and went to see <strong>Sunworld Sa Pa</strong>, an amazing place way up in the clouds. Took a cable car that holds a Guinness World Record for the highest elevation. The views from the summit of <strong>Fansipan</strong>, the highest peak of Vietnam, was just jaw-dropping.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Buddha statues and prayer flags within the mist of literal clouds. Insanely steep steps to go up and down the mountain and through the clouds with small stalls for snacks and water all along the way. We stopped in one of those stalls to have a quick bite of Pork Sausages and Satay.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We came back down at dusk and headed to <strong>Heaven’s Gate</strong>, just in time for a mind-blowing sunset view. After all this we were surely very very hungry, so we decided to end the day in style and went to a French Diner called <strong>Le Gecko</strong>. It was my first time trying a <em>rib eye steak</em>. I also had a <em>cheese ham burger with fries.</em></p>\n<h2>Day 3</h2>\n<p>Reached <strong>Hanoi</strong> at around 3 in the morning. Started heading back to our hotel as we knew this day will be a long one too. Got a few hours of sleep then made our way to the pickup point for the Bus to none other than….<strong>Ha Long Bay!</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I was personally very very excited for this day as I’ve been seeing and hearing about <strong>Ha Long Bay</strong> for quite some time now and couldn’t wait to see it with my own eyes.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Trust me when I say it’s worth the visit. Emerald waters and towering limestone islands that create a stunning natural seascape. A mesmerising destination where you can cruise amidst thousands of picturesque islands and experience the magic of Vietnam\'s coastal beauty.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>So yeah, we took a cruise through these gems in the sea. Had drinks and food, feeling the cool breeze. The package we booked also included <strong>Sung Sot caves</strong> which is renowned for its stunning stalactites and stalagmites formations, which create intricate patterns and otherworldly landscapes within its chambers.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We even went kayaking, it was my first time, in the <strong>Ha Long Bay</strong> sea. Paddling through the cold blue water with limestone islands towering over us all around.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Cruised back to port and headed back to Hanoi. We had some time before dinner so we paid a visit to the famous <strong>St. Joseph’s Cathedral</strong>. Decided to have dinner at an Indian place called <strong>Maazi</strong> where we had <em>Mutton Curry, Chettinad Mutton, Biriyani, Naan</em> and what not! It was just day 3 and we were already missing Indian food.</p>\n<h2>Day 4</h2>\n<p>The next day we went straight to the airport early morning as we had a flight to <strong>Da Nang</strong>. On reaching <strong>Da Nang</strong>, we really got some real vacation feels. Sunny weather, beach-y vibes, drinks and snacks everywhere, people dancing and enjoying the day at the shore. We made the cab driver dance on <em>Daler Mehndi’s Tunak Tunak Tun 😂.</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>So without being an exception, we grabbed a drink and walked along the beach, waves hitting our feet every now and then.</p>\n<p>At dusk, we decided to try some local food. Had <em>Bánh mì, sun dried fish skins, crab chops.</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>As soon as it was dark, we rented motorbikes (scooties) and made our way to <strong>Hội An, </strong>a well preserved ancient town<strong>.</strong> Drove 30km to get there while breaking the 40 kmph speed limit several times. Obviously.</p>\n<p>Did the lantern boat ride and feasted on some <em>Pork Satay and Octopus</em>, then headed back to <strong>Da Nang </strong>and called it a day!</p>\n<h2>Day 5</h2>\n<p>The next day was a relatively chilled one. All we did was lie down on the sands at the shore and let waves do the talking. Beaches in <strong>Da Nang</strong> has bean bags and tables all along the shore, for people to come sit and order some food and drinks. So we did just that. Fought with the waves for 3 hours and had <em>Squid Noodles </em>as the reward.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Dining and enjoying the view made us lose the sense of time and we didn’t realise when it got dark. So, we headed back to our rooms, took a shower and went to see the statue of <strong>Lady Buddha</strong>. Unfortunately it was closed by the time we reached there, even though it wasn’t very far, we could see it from the window in our room all this time, so we just admired it from afar.</p>\n<h2>Day 6</h2>\n<p>This day included the <strong>Marble Mountain of Da Nang</strong>. A huge mountain (more like a hill) in the middle of the city with temples, pagodas, chambers, stairs, towers and checkpoints all inside of it. They gave us a map to help us traverse the whole thing!</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We got back down and had some sugarcane juice. We tried a momo in Vietnam for the first time. The reason I said “a momo” is because it was a big one, the size of your entire palm. They call it <em>Bánh bao</em><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>Then we caught a bus which took us to <strong>SunWorld Da Nang</strong>.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Here we witnessed the famous <strong>Golden Bridge</strong>. A bridge held by 2 hands situated on top a hill within the clouds.</p>\n<p>Took a cable car to get there which literally went through the clouds half way through. We could see mist coming in the cable car through it’s small windows.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Had a buffet dinner with a live music. Had <em>sausages, salami, oysters, cheese pasta, spaghetti and chicken bolognese</em>.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>It was late and we booked a cab back to the hotel, playing retro Bollywood songs while we speed through empty freeway roads.</p>\n<h2>Day 7</h2>\n<p>Woke up early and headed towards the airport for a flight back to <strong>Hanoi</strong>.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We got to know the timings of the train on <strong>Train Street</strong> so we rushed to not miss it. Had the famous <em>egg coffee</em> while the train was moving just 1 metre away from the mug I was holding.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>And for the last day in Vietnam, we want to end things with some luxury. We had a reservation at <strong>Capella Hanoi</strong>, a <em>Michelin</em> starred diner where we ate like kings and summed up a billed of <em>4.3 million Vietnamese dong 😎! </em>Yeah! You read that just right.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>It was time to say goodbye to Vietnam as we headed towards the airport for our flight back to Delhi. 😔</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>And that\'s a wrap on our adventure in a country where natural beauty is still perfectly preserved. A country where you could call yourself a multi-millionaire with a few thousand rupees exchanged. A place where people don’t try to loot or scam tourists. A nation where hearing <em>Xin chào</em> from an Indian brings a smile on people’s face.</p>',
